# Iris-Flower-Datset
Python - IRIS Data visualization

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can  be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris classes with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:
sepal-length
sepal-width
petal-length
petal-width
class

Iris Flower Visualisation.py is python program written in version 3.5 which tries to find some useful insights from Iris Datset.
